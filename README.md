### Hello! I'm Seunggun. ðŸ‘‹

I am an undergraduate at New York University majoring in Computer Science and Economics. Originally from Republic of Korea, I've grown up as a life-long bilingual - and love exploring the intricacies of language through Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Currently, I am a data science intern at Fundbloc, a real-estate proptech startup in Seoul. I am also a NLP research assistant under [Professor Sedoc](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/joao-sedoc).
